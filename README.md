# Ruby-exercise
Ruby parsing exercise

## Objective
Create a ruby project that retrieves and parses the pricing information in the next page:
https://www.port-monitor.com/plans-and-pricing

The output should be simmilar to this, containing all the pricing information (this is just a suggestion):

```ruby
[
    {
        monitors: 10,
        check_rate: 60,
        history: 12,
        multiple_notifications: true,
        push_notifications: true,
        price: 4.54
    },
    {
        monitors: 20,
        check_rate: 60,
        history: 12,
        multiple_notifications: true,
        push_notifications: true,
        price: 8.29
    },    
]
```
